# File Synchronization
I have been wondering to work on this project for a long long time. And I want to take this opportunity to learn C# for the first time and refresh my React/Typescript skills. 

The project is implemented by seperating the frontend and backend. One uses Nextjs and the other uese .Net core. For detailed documentation, navigate to specific folder. 

Thanks for reading.
